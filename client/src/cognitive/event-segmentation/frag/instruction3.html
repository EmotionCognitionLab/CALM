<h1>How to Complete this Task</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Watch the video attentively and continuously</strong>&mdash;it will not pause when you press the space bar.</li>
    <li><strong>Press the space bar each time you feel an event boundary has occurred.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>There are no right or wrong answers.</strong> We are interested in how <strong>you naturally perceive</strong> events.</li>
    <li><strong>The number of times you press the space bar is up to you,</strong> but please press it at least once.</li>
    <li><strong>People may segment events at different levels of detail,</strong> and that's completely fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask before we begin! The video will begin right away.</p>
