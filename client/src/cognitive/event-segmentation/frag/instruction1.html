<h1>Segmenting Videos into Different Events</h1>
<p>
    In this task, you will watch a 4-minute video of a person performing a task. The video is filmed from a single, fixed perspectiveâ€”like a camera on a tripod. There will be no cuts or edits, but you may still notice natural and meaningful changes between different units of activity. These "units" can be thought of as events.
</p>
<p>
    Your job is to press the space bar whenever you believe one meaningful event has ended and a new one has begun.
