<h1>What is an Event Boundary?</h1>
<p>
    An event boundary marks a significant shift in what is happening. These boundaries often occur when:
    <ul>
        <li>A person starts or stops a specific action.</li>
        <li>The goal or focus of the activity changes.</li>
        <li>There is a meaningful shift or change in the situation even though the video remains continuous.</li>
    </ul>
