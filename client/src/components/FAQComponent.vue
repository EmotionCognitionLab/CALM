        <h2 class="left">Ear Sensor Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the ear sensor wires are untangled and straight, with no knots. Tangled wires can interfere with data transmission.</li>
            <li>Clean the ear sensor clip with the provided microfiber cloth, as oil and dirt buildup can interfere with the sensor signal. Additionally, wipe your earlobes with a regular cloth or towel (not the microfiber cloth) to remove any oil and dirt that could affect the sensor's performance.</li>
            <li>Try plugging the ear sensor into different USB ports on the laptop, as USB ports can wear out over time.</li>
            <li>Place the sensor on the part of your earlobe closest to your neck.</li>
            <li>Cold earlobes can prevent the sensor from accurately collecting pulse data. Warm your earlobes by rubbing them with your thumb and index finger until they are warm. Alternatively, hold a cup of hot water to warm your hands and then rub your earlobes.</li>
            <li>Try placing the ear sensor on your other earlobe.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="left">Laptop Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the charger is connected to a power outlet during your training.</li>
            <li>Confirm that you are connected to Wi-Fi and that airplane mode is off.</li>
            <li>Restart your laptop. Disconnect from the Wi-Fi, then reconnect.</li>
            <li>If you receive update notifications regarding your laptop/apps, please disregard. DO NOT UPDATE.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="left">App Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If your screen is stuck on the “Please wait while we upload your data”, “Crunching your numbers”, or “Logging you in” page for more than 2 minutes, please click File > Exit to close the app, then relaunch the app.</li>
        </ul>
